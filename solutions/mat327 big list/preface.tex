\chapter{Preface}

I attempt to answer and \LaTeX all of the solutions to the big list of problems posted by my
instructor Ivan Khatchatourian for MAT327: Introduction to Topology. The problems are 
separated into difficulties which are labelled via asterisks. One asterisk being the lowest
difficulty and 3 being the highest. Especially hard problems are marked via a cross. This
is the format my instructor uses and I'm merely copying it for consistency's sake.
