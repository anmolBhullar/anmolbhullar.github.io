	\Exercise[difficulty=1] Fix $a<b\in\RR$. Show explicitly that the %
    open interval $(a,b)$ is open in $\RR_{\text{usual}}$. Show %
    explicitly that the interval $[a,b)$ is not open in %
    $\RR_{\text{usual}}$

	\Answer First, we show that $(a, b)$ is open in %
    $\mathbb{R}_{\text{usual}}$. To do this: we have to show that %
    for any point $x\in (a,b)$, there exists a neigbourhood $N(x,\e) %
    \subseteq (a,b)$.\\
    Thus, choose a point $x\in(a,b)$. By density of $\RR$, there %
    exists $x_1\in(a,x)$ and $x_2\in(x,b)$. Let $\e =$ min$(x_1,x_2).%
    $ Then $N(x,\e) \subseteq (a,b)$.\\
    Next, we show that $[a,b)$ is not open. To do this, we show that %
    $\exists$ no $\e>0$ such that $N(a,\e) \subseteq [a,b)$. Note %
    that any $x\in (a-\e,a]$ would not be in $(a,b)$ for any $\e>0$, %
    so $N(a,\e)\not\subseteq [a,b)$.

    \Exercise[difficulty=1] Let $X$ be a set and $\mathcal{B} = %
    \{ \{x\}: x\in X\}$. Show that the only topology on $X$ that %
    contains $\B$ as a subset is the discrete topology.

    \Answer To show that only $X_{\text{discrete}}$ has the property %
    $\B\subseteq X_{\text{discrete}}$, consider the set:
    \[\T := \{ \{x\}: x\in X\}\]
    For $\T$ to be a topology, it must be closed under finite %
    intersections so we must put $\emptyset$ in $\T$. Furthermore, %
    $\T$ must be closed under the union of an arbitrary collection %
    elements of $X$. If this is to be true, then $\T$ must contain %
    every subset of $X$ since any arbritrary subset can be written %
    as the union of all of its elements. Thus an arbitrary subset %
    $A\subseteq X$ must be in $\T$. This implies %
    $\T = X_{\text{discrete}}$.

    \Exercise[difficulty=1] Let $(X, \T_{\text{co-countable}})$ be %
    an infinite set with the co-countable topology. Show that %
    $\T_{\text{co-countable}}$ is closed under countable %
    intersections but not necessairly arbitrary ones.

    \Answer Given a countable indexing set $I$, we have to show %
    \[\bigcap_{\alpha\in I} U_{\alpha} \in \T_{\text{co-countable}}\]
    Equivalently, we can show $X \setminus (\cap U_{\alpha})$ %
    is countable. By DeMorgan's Law: $X\setminus(\cap_{\alpha})=
    \cup (X\setminus U_{\alpha})$. Since the right hand side %
    is the countable union of countable sets, it is countable.
    Thus, $\cap U_{\alpha} \in \T_{\text{co-countable}}$. To show %
    that an arbitrary intersection of elements is not open, it %
    suffices to state that the intersection of arbitrary many %
    elements does not necessairly form a countable set.

    \Exercise[difficulty=1] Let $(X, \T)$ be a topological space, %
    and let $A\subseteq X$ be a set with the property that for all %
    $x\in A,\;\exists$ an open set $U_x\in\T$ such that $x\in U_x %
    \subseteq A$. Show that $A$ is open.

    \Answer Let $I$ be a set which indexes the elements of $A$. Then:
    \[\bigcup_{\alpha\in I} \{x_{\alpha}\} = A\]
    Similarly, since $x_{\alpha} \in U_{x_{\alpha}}$ and %
    $U_{x_{\alpha}} \subseteq A$, then:
    \[\bigcup_{\alpha\in I} U_{x_{\alpha}} = A\]
    Since this is the union of arbitrary elements of $\T$, then %
    $A\in\T$.
