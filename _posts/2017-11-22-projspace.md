title: The Real Projective Space is an example of an abstract (smooth) manifold
summary: Yet another classical example of an abstract smooth manifold
---

For the sake of completeness, let us start with the definition of an abstract manifold.

Let \\(X\\) be a topological space. A __chart__ (or coordinate chart) is an open set \\(U\subseteq X\\)
together with a homeomorphism \\(\phi: U \to \mathbb{R}^n\\). An __atlas__ is a collection of charts \\( \{\(U_{\alpha},\phi_{\alpha})\} \\) with the condition
\\( X = \cup_{\alpha\in A} U_{\alpha} \\). A __smooth atlas__ is an atlas such that whenever \\( U_{\alpha} \cap U_{\beta} \neq \emptyset \\), the composition
\\( \phi_{\beta} \circ \phi_{\alpha}^{-1} : \phi_{\alpha}(U_{\alpha} \cap U_{\beta}) \to \phi_{\beta}(U_{\alpha}\cap U_{\beta}) \\) i.e. every _transition map_ is smooth.
Two smooth atlases are __equivalent__ if their union is also a smooth atlas. This gives a natural equivalence class of smoothly equivalent atlases 
which we call a __smooth structure__. More specifically, define an equivalence relation \\( \sim \\) where \\( P \sim Q \\) if \\(P, Q\\) are smooth atlases that are
equivalent. The equivalence class generated by this relation is called a smooth structure.

Before we talk about the real projective space \\( \mathbb{R}P^n \\), we talk about the \\(n = 2\\) case.

### Definition (Real Projective Plane)
Let \\(\mathbb{R}P^2\\) denote the set of lines in \\(\mathbb{R}^3\\) that go through the origin. We say that 
\\(\mathbb{R}P^2\\) is the __real projective plane__.

To show this set is an abstract manifold, we first have to define a topology on it. For each line, identify two antipodal points
each magnitude 1 from the origin. This defines the set \\(S^2\\). A simple figure is provided below.

### How does this fit in with my previous understanding of coordinates?

You may have thought coordinates as something which was _implicitly_ connected to the space
you were working in (e.g. \\(\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R}^2, ...\\)) in the way that giving a
coordinate was the same as pointing out a unique place on the space. This is in fact, still
correct. In this case, let \\(X = \mathbb{R}^n\\) and if our neighbourhood \\(U \subset X\\)
is of dimension \\(k\\), then we let it be the identity mapping.
