title: How the set of n by n orthogonal matrices form a (smooth) manifold.
---

Preface: This article is the beginning of a series of articles about 
random parts about math that I find really cool.

Before we get started, it is always good to give some definitions so
as to avoid any confusion.

What is a (smooth) manifold?

A set \\( X\subset\mathbb{R}^n \\) such that for any point $x\in X$, 
there exists a neighbourhood \\( N(x,\epsilon) \\) such that there
exists a diffeomorphism ( \\( C^{\infty} \\) and bijective) 
\\( f: \mathbb{R}^k \to N(x,\epsilon) \\). In this case, 
\\( X \\) is said to be of dimension \\( k \\).

What is a tangent space?

Let \\(X\\) be a \\(k\\)-dimensional manifold
