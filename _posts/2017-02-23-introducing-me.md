Welcome to my website!

Over the past year, I've been reading a fair bit of math textbooks of which I've made plenty of notes from and have written down solutions of problems from some of their chapters. I hope to upload these
onto this site for more organized web keeping and so that anyone in the world can access them. I hope to update this website at the most biweekly with either LaTeX'd notes or LaTeX'd solutions to
problems. I will probably upload notes to some of my courses but they will often be incomplete - especially the ones of courses I have already completed.

I'm still not sure what format I want to be uploading notes/solutions in. Currently, I have set up this website with Github Pages using Jekyll because it was a quick way of just getting my website online.
This is a problem because Github Pages are meant to be for static pages only. While I don't plan on doing anything crazy with this website it would be nice later down the road to not have such a limitation.
Currently, I'm thinking of embedding the PDF notes/solutions using this [solution](http://jamesonzimmer.com/simple-pdf-embed-for-jekyll/) and giving them the option to download if they please.

Head to the <a href="https://github.com/anmolbhullar/anmolbhullar.github.io">Github repository</a> for downloads of the pdfs, any typo reports or even feature requests.

Thanks!
