title: Solutions To Some Topology Problems
summary: I like having my mathematics organized / in one place so I decided to write up some solutions

I won't be posting the problems themselves because these problems aren't mine own but from elsewhere.
Links or source will be posted so you can look up the problems there.

#### Solutions below for Munkres' Topology \\( \S 13\\)

1. If for every \\(x\in A\\), there is an open set \\(x\in U, U \subset A\\). Then let,
\\(\mathcal{U}\\) be the set of all such \\(U's\\). Then \\(\mathcal{U}\\) is at most uncountable.
But the union of an uncountable number of open sets is still open, so \\(\cup U_i\\) is still open.
Furthermore, since every \\(U_i\subset A\\), then \\(\cup U_i = A\\). So, that \\(A\\) is an open set.
