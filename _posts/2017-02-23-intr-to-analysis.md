title: Notes for Introduction to Analysis
---

The first order of business is to upload my notes for a course I'm taking called Introduction to Analysis. It covers all of the basic topics a student might need to know before they can tackle on a Real Analysis course. I will also be uploading solutions to the problems in the textbook we are using for this course which is called <em>Real Analysis and Foundations by Steven G. Krantz (4th Ed.)</em>.

The notes are embedded below or can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/anmolbhullar/anmolbhullar.github.io/notes/matb43.pdf).

The solutions of the textbook problems will start from section 4.3 which is on compactness on the real line. They can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/anmolbhullar/anmolbhullar.github.io/solutions/krantz/compact.pdf).
