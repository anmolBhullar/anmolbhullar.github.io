## A little bit about me

I am an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto, Scarborough currently studying Mathematics. I read way too many unrelated books
on mathematics than I probably should. I play Dota 2. I love poutine. But perhaps, the quality that I am most proud of is my ability to snap
my fingers.

## What is this website about

It's meant to showcase what I do! Which granted is not much, but I am trying to use the time that I don't spend on school and instead spend
reading irrelevant books (with respect to my courses) more efficiently via organizing my notes on readings in a place that is easy to access
and perhaps even share my notes to the world. I will probably also showcase some of my graphic design work from time to time.

Thus, to answer the question, I suppose this website is a mix between a blog, resource center and a portfolio website.
