I am a 19-year old student at the University of Toronto (Scarborough Campus) currently
studying Computer Science and Mathematics. This blog was created in hopes of bringing
them together! I will be writing articles on cool mathematics e.g. proofs or exposes
on cool fields within mathematics, and I will also be showcasing some cool programs
I've made on here. In order to challenge myself, I've decided to write a new
article once every two weeks (excluding exam seasons for obvious reasons).

Feel free to contact me if you find any typos or if you have some questions about
whatever I wrote. I check my emails fairly regularly so I should reply back within
a day or two. To contact me, just click on the top right button.

This blog uses the Pixyll template which itself uses Jekyll and a host of other cool libraries.
