   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Preface: This article is the beginning of a series of articles about 
random parts about math that I find really cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we get started, it is always good to give some definitions so
as to avoid any confusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is a (smooth) manifold?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A set \( X\subset\mathbb{R}^n \) such that for any point $x\in X$, 
there exists a neighbourhood \( N(x,\epsilon) \) such that there
exists a diffeomorphism ( \( C^{\infty} \) and bijective) 
\( f: \mathbb{R}^k \to N(x,\epsilon) \). In this case, 
\( X \) is said to be of dimension \( k \).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is a tangent space?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let \(X\) be a \(k\)-dimensional manifold. Then,
there exists a mapping \( f: \mathbb{R}^k \to N(x,\epsilon) \). Let
\(df_{x}: \mathbb{R}^k \to \mathbb{R}^n \)
be the directional derivative of \(f\) at \(x\in\mathbb{R}^k\). The
image of \(df_{x}\) is called the tangent space of \(X\) denoted by
\(T_{x}(X)\). Thus \(df_{x}\) is the mapping from \(\mathbb{R}^k\to T_{x}(X)\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is an orthogonal matrix? A symmetric matrix?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An orthogonal matrix is a generalized notion of the rotation matrix \(R\theta\) in \(\mathbb{R}^2\)
in the sense that these matrices are distance preserving functions or more
formally known as isomoteries which are perhaps one of the nicest functions we can
find between two arbitrary metric spaces. An orthogonal matrix is a matrix consisting
of orthonormal vectors, or more specifically, a matrix \(Q\) is orthogonal if:
\[ QQ^{T} = I \] where \(I\) is the identity \(n\times n\) matrix. Symmetric
matrices are matrices which can be diagonalized by orthogonal matrices i.e. for
every symmetric matrix \(A\), there exists an orthogonal matrix \(Q\) such that
\[ D = Q^{T}AQ \] where \(D\) is the diagonal matrix. A much more usual definition
of symmetric matrices is any matrix whose transpose is itself, i.e.
\[ A = A^{T} \]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let \(O(n)\) be the set of \(n\times n\) orthogonal matrices, \(S(n)\) for symmetric matrices and
\(M(n)\) for any general matrix in \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remark: Consider the matrix \(A\in M(n)\) which
has \(n^2\) entries. Thus, \(M(n)\) can be viewed as the set \(\mathbb{R}^{n^{2}}\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remark: We know that, \(S(n)\) forms a subspace under the vector space \(M(n)\). Thus, we can calculate
the dimension of this subspace explicitly. We know that to uniquely determine a symmetric matrix,
it suffices to only list the entries in the upper triangle part of the matrix as well as the 
diagonal. Thus, to uniquely determine an element in \(S(n)\), we need:
\[ \frac{n^{2}}{2} + n = \frac{(n)(n+1)}{2} \]
elements. Thus, \(S(n)\) is of dimension \(\mathbb{R}^{k}\) where \(k=\frac{(n)(n+1)}{2}\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This proof that \(O(n)\) is a manifold under \(M(n)=\mathbb{R}^{n^{2}}\) is a very clear
application of the pre-image theorem so we state it first but before, we state that, we need to have
a notion of a regular value. So we state these two things now before attempting to prove anything:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is a regular value?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let \(f: X\to Y\) be a smooth map between manifolds. Then \(y\) is a regular value of \(f\) if
and only if every for all \(x\in f^{-1}(y) \), \(df_{x}: T_{x}(X) \to T_{y}(Y)\) is surjective
(where \(y = f(x)\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the pre-image theorem?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If \(y\) is a regular value of \(f: X\to Y\), then the preimage \(f^{-1}(y)\) is a
submanifold of \(X\), with dim \(f^{-1}(y) =\) dim \(X\) - dim \(Y\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, for our purposes, let \(f: M(n) \to S(n)\) via \(A \mapsto AA^{T}\). Since for any orthogonal
matrix \(Q\), \(QQ^{T} = I\), it follows that we want to determine if the preimage \(f^{-1}(I)\)
is a submanifold of \(M(n)\). Thus, it leaves us to check that \(I\) is a regular value of \(f\)
or in other words, it leaves us to check that for any \(A\in f^{-1}(I)\) (so any orthogonal matrix),
\(df_{A}: T_{A}(M(n)) \to T_{f(A)}(S(n))\) is surjective. First, note that for any \(B\in M(n)\):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\[
        df_{A}(B) &amp;amp;= \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(A+h)-f(A)}{h} &lt;br /&gt;
        &amp;amp;= \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{(A+h)(A+h)^{T} - AA^{T}}{h} &lt;br /&gt;
        &amp;amp;= \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{AA^{T} + hBA^{T} + hAB^{T} + h^{2}BB^{T} - AA^{T}}{h} &lt;br /&gt;
        &amp;amp;= \lim_{h\to 0} BA^{T} + AB^{T} + hBB^{T} &lt;br /&gt;
        &amp;amp;= BA^{T} + AB^{T}
\]&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://localhost:4000/2017/03/13/mat257-notes</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;These notes are from a course called &lt;em&gt;MAT257: Analysis II&lt;/em&gt;. It is the more theoretical version of MAT237. The notes are found from
Dr. Dror Bar-Natan’s website &lt;a href=&quot;http://drorbn.net/index.php?title=1617-257&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The notes posted here are all of them compiled into
a single document as well as having been typeset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notes can be downloaded from my Github &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/anmolBhullar/anmolbhullar.github.io/tree/master/notes&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Advanced Calculus Problem Sets</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/2017/03/12/advanced-calc-psets/"/>

   <id>http://localhost:4000/2017/03/12/advanced-calc-psets</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;These problem sets are from a course I am taking called &lt;em&gt;MAT237: Advanced Calculus&lt;/em&gt;, it is a year long course on second year
calculus, we cover all the topics on multi-variable differentiation/integration as well as covering topology in R^n to
supplement the theory behind those topics. Later in the course, it gets quite geometric heavy as calculus naturally tends to get
more differential geometry if one to continue in it. The questions were given from &lt;a href=&quot;http://utmat237.com&quot;&gt;our class website&lt;/a&gt;.
I am posting my solutions for these problem sets below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can be downloaded from my Github &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/anmolBhullar/anmolbhullar.github.io/tree/master/solutions/mat237&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://localhost:4000/2017/02/24/intr-to-analysis</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The first order of business is to upload my notes for a course I’m taking called Introduction to Analysis. It covers all of the basic topics a student might need to know before they can tackle on a Real Analysis course. I will also be uploading solutions to the problems in the textbook we are using for this course which is called &lt;em&gt;Real Analysis and Foundations by Steven G. Krantz (4th Ed.)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notes are embedded below or can be downloaded &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/anmolbhullar/anmolbhullar.github.io/tree/master/notes&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solutions of the textbook problems will start from section 4.3 which is on compactness on the real line. They can be downloaded &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/anmolbhullar/anmolbhullar.github.io/tree/master/solutions/krantz&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>My plans for this website</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/2017/02/23/introducing-me/"/>
   <updated>2017-02-23T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/2017/02/23/introducing-me</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my website!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, I’ve been reading a fair bit of math textbooks of which I’ve made plenty of notes from and have written down solutions of problems from some of their chapters. I hope to upload these
onto this site for more organized web keeping and so that anyone in the world can access them. I hope to update this website at the most biweekly with either LaTeX’d notes or LaTeX’d solutions to
problems. I will probably upload notes to some of my courses but they will often be incomplete - especially the ones of courses I have already completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m still not sure what format I want to be uploading notes/solutions in. Currently, I have set up this website with Github Pages using Jekyll because it was a quick way of just getting my website online.
This is a problem because Github Pages are meant to be for static pages only. While I don’t plan on doing anything crazy with this website it would be nice later down the road to not have such a limitation.
Currently, I’m thinking of embedding the PDF notes/solutions using this &lt;a href=&quot;http://jamesonzimmer.com/simple-pdf-embed-for-jekyll/&quot;&gt;solution&lt;/a&gt; and giving them the option to download if they please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Head to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/anmolbhullar/anmolbhullar.github.io&quot;&gt;Github repository&lt;/a&gt; for downloads of the pdfs, any typo reports or even feature requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
