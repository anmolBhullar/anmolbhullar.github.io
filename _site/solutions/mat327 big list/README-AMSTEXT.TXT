AMSTEXT STYLE PACKAGE
---------------------

This package contains files to help authors use AMS-LaTeX to prepare a
manuscript for publication in the AMS book series Pure and Applied
Undergraduate Texts.  We assume that the following software is installed
on your system.

    LaTeX           version 2e, December 1995 or later
    AMS-LaTeX       version 2.0, December 1999 or later
    AMSFonts        version 2.0, January 1995 or later

If you have an older version of LaTeX or AMS-LaTeX, please upgrade,  You
can retrieve the current version of AMS-LaTeX from the AMS web server at

    http://www.ams.org/tex/amslatex.html

We also assume that you are familiar with LaTeX and AMS-LaTeX document
structuring commands such as \section, \footnote, \newtheorem, etc., and
with the techniques for inputting math expressions.

1) This package contains the following files.

general files

    README-AMSTEXT.TXT     overview of the AMSTEXT package (this file)
    instr-l.pdf            Instructions
    handbk.pdf             AMS Author Handbook
    creating-graphics.pdf  Creating graphics for use in books and journals

AMSTEXT-specific files

    amstext-l.cls            AMSTEXT document class file
    amstext-l-template.tex   AMSTEXT topmatter template

sample document files

    amstext-doc.tex      series documentation source file
    amstext-doc.pdf      series documentation PDF file

2) Start by making a copy of the file amstext-l-template.tex to
<uniquename>.tex, using a distinct name (perhaps your last name) in
place of <uniquename>.  This will be your "driver file".  Fill in the
top matter (title, author(s), etc.) following the instructions that
appear as comments in the file.

Please note that the title page generated by this package is intended as
a placeholder, for information only.  The final title page will be created
at the AMS using the information provided on this placeholder page.

We recommend that chapters be prepared as separate files, beginning with
\chapter{...} and ending with \endinput; the chapters in the documentation
source file can be used as models.  The chapter files are then called in
using the \include{...} commands in your driver file.

3) More detailed instructions are given in the files instr-l.pdf and
handbk.pdf.  These manuals are also available via the web from
     ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/author-info/documentation/amslatex/instr-l.pdf
and  ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/author-info/documentation/handbk.pdf
respectively.  The handbook includes a checklist to be consulted, before
keyboarding your manuscript, in order to avoid the most common problems,
and detailed instructions for submitting your files to the AMS.

4) If your textbook will contain figures, print out, or view on screen,
the file creating-graphics.pdf and read it.  This file contains general
and specific guidelines for preparation of graphics (line art,
photographs, and other forms of illustrations) in a manner that will
ensure their accurate reproduction.

5) The source and printable versions of the series documentation,
amstext-doc.tex and amstext-doc.pdf, illustrate the series style and
explain its special features.

Do NOT use the amstext-doc.tex file as a "starter" for your textbook.
Use the template file instead.  The documentation source file should be
used only for your reference.

6) Various technical and administrative information can be found in the
AMS Author FAQ:
    http://www.ams.org/authors/author-faq.html
This document contains information on various topics that have been the
subject of questions to our Technical Support Group, as well as links
to other useful web pages, including the page with instructions for
submitting files when your manuscript is ready.


Should you have any technical questions that aren't answered by the FAQ,
please contact our Technical Support Group.  The most effective method
is to send electronic mail to tech-support@ams.org, including a concise
statement of the problem, along with (if appropriate) a brief file that
illustrates the problem and the log of your attempt to LaTeX the file.
If e-mail is not an option, you can call 800-321-4AMS (800-321-4267,
in the U.S. or Canada) or 401-455-4080, or write to Technical Support,
Publications Technical Group, AMS, 201 Charles Street, Providence,
RI 02904-2294.
