        How the set of n by n orthogonal matrices forms a lie group.
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">13 Jun 2017</span>

    <p>Preface: This article is the beginning of a series of articles about 
random parts about math that I find really cool.</p>

<p>I’ve always suspected that algebra and differential topology were somehow connected in some way, 
(after all, a lot of fields in Math are like this) but I’ve personally done any math which integrates
algebra and differential topology so seamlessly. This is why when I encountered this in <em>Differential
Topology by Victor Guillemin and Allan Pollack</em>, it blew my mind. This is why I wanted to write
this article to showcase the relationship between lie groups and orthogonal matrices.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-an-orthogonal-matrix">What is an Orthogonal Matrix?</h3>

<p>Consider the rotation matrix \(R(\theta)\) in \(\mathbb{R}^2\). This is a matrix/transformation
which is distance preserving. I mean, ‘distance preserving’ in the same sense of the functions that
one would use to apply a change of variables in an integral. If we generalize this notion of linear
maps which are distance preserving, we obtain the idea of an orthogonal matrix. For example, in
order for a matrix \(Q\) to be distance preserving, we can say that it needs to preserve the dot
product, so, we can say that if \(Q\) is an \(n\times n\) dimensional matrix (i.e. a function
\(\mathbb{R^n} \to \mathbb{R^n})\), then it must obey the following rule for \(u,v\in\mathbb{R}^n\):
\[ u\cdot v = (Qu)\cdot(Qv)\]
This implies an important result. For any \(v\in\mathbb{R}^n\), we have that:
\[ v^{T}\cdot v = (Qv)^{T}\cdot(Qv) = (v^{T}Q^{T})(Qv) = v^{T}(Q^{T}Q)v \]
which implies that \(Q^{T}Q = I\) or in other words: \(Q^{T} = Q^{-1}\). Thus, we can just
define orthogonal matrices as matrices whose inverse is equal to its transpose.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-show-the-set-of-ntimes-n-orthogonal-matrices-form-a-smooth-manifold">Step 1: Show the set of \(n\times n\) orthogonal matrices form a smooth manifold</h3>

<p>Let \(O(n)\) be the set of \(n\times n\) orthogonal matrices, \(S(n)\) for symmetric matrices and
\(M(n)\) for any general matrix in \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\).</p>

<p>Remark: We know that, \(S(n)\) forms a subspace under the vector space \(M(n)\). Thus, we can calculate
the dimension of this subspace explicitly. We know that to uniquely determine a symmetric matrix,
it suffices to only list the entries in the upper triangle part of the matrix as well as the 
diagonal. Thus, to uniquely determine an element in \(S(n)\), we need:
\[ \frac{n^{2}}{2} + n = \frac{(n)(n+1)}{2} \]
elements. Thus, \(S(n)\) is of dimension \(\mathbb{R}^{k}\) where \(k=\frac{(n)(n+1)}{2}\).</p>

<p>This proof that \(O(n)\) is a manifold under \(M(n)=\mathbb{R}^{n^{2}}\) is a very clear
application of the pre-image theorem so we state it first but before, we state that, we need to have
a notion of a regular value. So we state these two things now before attempting to prove anything:</p>

<p>What is a regular value?</p>

<p>Let \(f: X\to Y\) be a smooth map between manifolds. Then \(y\) is a regular value of \(f\) if
and only if every for all \(x\in f^{-1}(y) \), \(df_{x}: T_{x}(X) \to T_{y}(Y)\) is surjective
where \(y = f(x)\).</p>

<p>What is the pre-image theorem?</p>

<p>If \(y\) is a regular value of \(f: X\to Y\), then the preimage \(f^{-1}(y)\) is a
submanifold of \(X\), with dim \(f^{-1}(y) =\) dim \(X\) - dim \(Y\).</p>

<p>Thus, for our purposes, let \(f: M(n) \to S(n)\) via \(A \mapsto AA^{T}\). Since for any orthogonal
matrix \(Q\), \(QQ^{T} = I\), it follows that we want to determine if the preimage \(f^{-1}(I)\)
is a submanifold of \(M(n)\). Thus, it leaves us to check that \(I\) is a regular value of \(f\)
or in other words, it leaves us to check that for any \(A\in f^{-1}(I)\) (so any orthogonal matrix),
\(df_{A}: T_{A}(M(n)) \to T_{f(A)}(S(n))\) is surjective. First, note that for any \(B\in M(n)\):</p>

<p>\begin{align}
        df_{A}(B) = \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(A+h)-f(A)}{h}
        = \lim_{h\to 0} BA^{T} + AB^{T} + hBB^{T}
        = BA^{T} + AB^{T}
\end{align}</p>

<p>So, we want to check that for any matrix \(C\in S(n)\), that, there exists \(B\in M(n)\) such
that \(df_{A}(B) = BA^{T} + AB^{T} = C\). Note that since \(C\) is symmetric, then
\(\frac{1}{2}C + \frac{1}{2}C^{T} = C\). Thus, if we suppose that \(BA^{T} = \frac{1}{2}C\), then:
\[ BA^{T} = \frac{1}{2}C \implies B = \frac{1}{2}CA\]
so,
\begin{align}
    BA^{T} + AB^{T} = (\frac{1}{2}CA)A^{T} + A(\frac{1}{2}CA)^{T} = \frac{1}{2}(C+C^{T}) = C
\end{align}</p>

<p>So, we see that \(df_{A}: M(n) \to S(n)\) is surjective for any \(A\in O(n)\), proving that
\(f^{-1}(I)=O(n)\) is a manifold under \(M(n)\).</p>

<p>In order, to show this is a lie group under the operation of matrix multiplication:
\[ O(n) \times O(n) \to O(n) \]
is a smooth operation, it suffices to show that if \(A,B\in O(n)\), then \(AB\) is an
orthogonal matrix. Note that:
\[ (AB)^{T}(AB) = B^{T}A^{T}(AB) = B^{T}B = I\]
so that \(AB\) is an orthogonal matrix. The inverse of this operation comes from the fact
that:
\[ A^{T} = A^{-1} \]
so this set also fulfills the definition of a group with the additional property that its
operation is smooth. Thus, \(O(n)\) is a lie group!</p>

    <p>These notes are from a course called <em>MAT257: Analysis II</em>. It is the more theoretical version of MAT237. The notes are found from
Dr. Dror Bar-Natan’s website <a href="http://drorbn.net/index.php?title=1617-257">here</a>. The notes posted here are all of them compiled into
a single document as well as having been typeset.</p>

        Advanced Calculus Problem Sets
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Mar 2017</span>

    <p>These problem sets are from a course I am taking called <em>MAT237: Advanced Calculus</em>, it is a year long course on second year
calculus, we cover all the topics on multi-variable differentiation/integration as well as covering topology in R^n to
supplement the theory behind those topics. Later in the course, it gets quite geometric heavy as calculus naturally tends to get
more differential geometry if one to continue in it. The questions were given from <a href="http://utmat237.com">our class website</a>.
I am posting my solutions for these problem sets below.</p>

<p>They can be downloaded from my Github <a href="https://github.com/anmolBhullar/anmolbhullar.github.io/tree/master/solutions/mat237">here</a>.</p>

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">24 Feb 2017</span>

    <p>The first order of business is to upload my notes for a course I’m taking called Introduction to Analysis. It covers all of the basic topics a student might need to know before they can tackle on a Real Analysis course. I will also be uploading solutions to the problems in the textbook we are using for this course which is called <em>Real Analysis and Foundations by Steven G. Krantz (4th Ed.)</em>.</p>

<p>The notes are embedded below or can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/anmolbhullar/anmolbhullar.github.io/tree/master/notes">here</a>.</p>
<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_F-4YnSC7qdUlBGbWZFZDM2bW8/preview" width="100%" height="500em"></iframe>

<p>The solutions of the textbook problems will start from section 4.3 which is on compactness on the real line. They can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/anmolbhullar/anmolbhullar.github.io/tree/master/solutions/krantz">here</a>.</p>

        My plans for this website
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">23 Feb 2017</span>

    <p>Welcome to my website!</p>

<p>Over the past year, I’ve been reading a fair bit of math textbooks of which I’ve made plenty of notes from and have written down solutions of problems from some of their chapters. I hope to upload these
onto this site for more organized web keeping and so that anyone in the world can access them. I hope to update this website at the most biweekly with either LaTeX’d notes or LaTeX’d solutions to
problems. I will probably upload notes to some of my courses but they will often be incomplete - especially the ones of courses I have already completed.</p>

<p>I’m still not sure what format I want to be uploading notes/solutions in. Currently, I have set up this website with Github Pages using Jekyll because it was a quick way of just getting my website online.
This is a problem because Github Pages are meant to be for static pages only. While I don’t plan on doing anything crazy with this website it would be nice later down the road to not have such a limitation.
Currently, I’m thinking of embedding the PDF notes/solutions using this <a href="http://jamesonzimmer.com/simple-pdf-embed-for-jekyll/">solution</a> and giving them the option to download if they please.</p>

<p>Head to the <a href="https://github.com/anmolbhullar/anmolbhullar.github.io">Github repository</a> for downloads of the pdfs, any typo reports or even feature requests.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
