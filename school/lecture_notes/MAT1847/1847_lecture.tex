    \chapter{Riemann Surfaces}

    The next three sections are meant to be an overview of background material required for this course.

    \section{Simply Connected Surfaces}

    \begin{definition}[Riemann Surface]
        A \textbf{Riemann surface} is a connected, paracompact, Hausdorff topological space $X$ equipped with an open covering $\{U_i\}$ 
        and a collection of homeomorphisms $f_i: U_i\to\mathbb{C}$ such that there exist analytic (i.e. holomorphic) $g_{ij}$ 
        such that
        \[ f_i \circ f_j^{-1} = g_{ij} \]
        where we have the assumption $U_i\cap U_j\neq 0$. We refer to the collection $\{(U_i,f_i)\}$ as the \textbf{chart} of 
        the Riemann surface. An equivalent way defining a Riemann surface is as follows:
        A Riemann surface is a connected complex analytic manifold of complex dimension 1.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{example}
        The complex plane $\mathbb{C}$ is the most basic Riemann surface. $\mathbb{C}$ is not only connected but also
        \textit{simply} connected and is also clearly Hausdorff and paracompact. The chart is given by $\{(\mathbb{C},i)\}$
        where $i: \mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}$ is the identity function. In fact, any non-empty open set $U$ of $\mathbb{C}$ (for example
        $\mathbb{H} = \{z\in\mathbb{C}: $Im$(z)>0\}$) is also a Riemann surface.
    \end{example}

    \begin{example}[Riemann sphere]
        The Riemann sphere is another example of a \textit{simply} connected Riemann surface. This sphere is not a subset
        of $\mathbb{C}$ nor is it biholomorphic to $\mathbb{C}$. This is the extended complex plane (i.e. $\mathbb{C}\cup\{\pm\infty\}$).
        Geometrically, this can be idealized using \textit{stereographic projection}:\\
        Identify the $xy-$plane (in $\mathbb{R}^3$) with $\mathbb{C}$. Let $\mathbb{S}$ be the sphere sitting in $\mathbb{R}^3$ centered
        at $(0,0,\nicefrac{1}{2})$ and of radius $\nicefrac{1}{2}$. Also, denote $\mathbb{N}$ to be the North pole of $\mathbb{S}$.
        Then, given any point $W = (X,Y,Z)$ on $\mathbb{S}-\mathbb{N}$, the line joining $N$ and $W$ intersects the $xy$-plane at
        a single point $w$. We say that $w$ is the \textbf{stereographic projection} of $W$. The inverse map can also be derived
        similarly, therefore we have a bijective mapping between $\mathbb{S}-\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{C}$. As the point $w$ goes to
        infinity in $\mathbb{C}$ (i.e. $|w|\to\infty$) the corresponding point $W$ on $\mathbb{S}$ comes arbitrarily close to 
        $\mathbb{N}$. Thus, we can define $\mathbb{N}$ to be the point at infinity. Therefore, we can identify the extended complex 
        plane with the sphere $\mathbb{S}$.
    \end{example}

    \begin{remark}
        We can show that the projection mapping is not only a bijective mapping but a \textit{diffeomorphic} mapping. This makes
        showing that transition maps are holomorphic not too hard.
    \end{remark}

    \begin{definition}[Conformal]
        A function $f:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}$ is \textbf{conformal} if it preserves angles.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{remark}
        A function $f:\mathbb{U}\to\mathbb{C}$ is \textbf{holomorphic} if
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item the Cauchy-Riemann equations hold i.e.
                \[ \overline{\partial}{f} = 0\qquad\text{and}\qquad \nicefrac{\partial{f}}{\partial{\overline{z}}} = 0 \]
            \item \[ \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(z+h)-f(z)}{h} = f'(z)\quad\text{exists} \]
            \item For all $z_0\in U$, there exists a convergent power series such that $f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_nz^n$ for
                $z$ in a neighbourhood of $z_0$.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{remark}

    \begin{remark}
        A holomorphic function $f:V\to\mathbb{C}$ is \textbf{conformal} if the derivative $f'(z)$ never vanishes i.e. $f'(z_0)\neq 0$
        for all $z\in V$. (note $f': V\to\mathbb{C}$ also and $f'(z)\neq 0$ implies that $f$ is locally injective). We can see this
        through:
        \begin{align*}
            f'(z_0) &= \lim_{h\to0} \frac{f(z+h)-f(z)}{h} \\
            \implies f(z+h) &\approx f(z) + f'(z)h
        \end{align*}
        Recall that multiplying by a number (non-zero and complex) is a composition of rotation and dilation so $f$ is conformal.
    \end{remark}

    There are three main \textit{simply} connected Riemann surfaces that are distinct (general case is uncountable).

    \begin{theorem}[Uniformization Theorem]
        Any simply connected Riemann surface is conformally isomorphic either
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item to the open disk $\mathbb{D}\subset\mathbb{C}$ consisting of all $|z|^2 < 1$ or,
            \item to the plane $\mathbb{C}$
            \item to the Riemann sphere $\hat{\mathbb{C}}$
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{theorem}

    To see that these are indeed inequivalent surfaces, we have to talk about the following:

    \begin{theorem}[Liouville]
        Every entire, bounded function is constant.
    \end{theorem}

    \begin{corollary}
        $\mathbb{C}$ is not biholomorphic to $\mathbb{D}$.
    \end{corollary}
    \begin{proof}
        Let $f$ be a holomorphic function $f:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{D}$. Then, $f$ is bounded since $D$ is bounded. By Liouville's
        theorem, we have that $f$ is constant. Since constant functions are clearly not bijective, we have that $f$ is not
        biholomorphic. Therefore, there exist no biholomorphic maps between $\mathbb{C}$ and $\mathbb{D}$. 
    \end{proof}

    It is clear that $\hat{\mathbb{C}}$ is not biholomorphic to any of the other Riemann surfaces on the list above since it is
    compact and the two other surfaces are not. Here is another way to arrive at the same conclusion:

    \begin{remark}
        There are no non-constant biholomorphic maps $f:\hat{\mathbb{C}}\to\mathbb{C}$.
    \end{remark}
    \begin{proof}
        It is clear that $f(\hat{\mathbb{C}})$ is compact since $\hat{\mathbb{C}}$ is and $f$ is continuous. By the open mapping
        theorem, if $f$ is non-constant, $f(\hat{\mathbb{C}})$ is open. However, there are no open compact subsets of $\mathbb{C}$.
        Therefore, $f$ is constant as wanted.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{remark}
        $\mathbb{D}\hookrightarrow \mathbb{C} \hookrightarrow \hat{\mathbb{C}}$.
    \end{remark}

    \begin{corollary}
        Every Riemann surface is the quotient of either $\mathbb{D},\mathbb{C}$, or $\hat{\mathbb{C}}$ by a discrete group $\Gamma$
        of automorphisms of $\mathbb{D},\mathbb{C},$ or $\hat{\mathbb{C}}$.
    \end{corollary}

    To prove this, we recall several algebraic and topological notions.

    \begin{definition}
        A map $p: M\to N$ between connected manifolds is a \textbf{covering map} if every point of $N$ has a connected open
        neighborhood $U$ within $N$ which is \textbf{evenly covered}; that is, each component $p^{-1}(U)$ must map onto $U$
        by a homeomorphism. The manifold $N$ is \textbf{simply connected} if it has no nontrivial coverings, that is, if every
        such covering map $M \to N$ is a homeomorphism. For any connected manifold $N$, there exists a covering map $\widetilde{N}
        \to N$ such that $\widetilde{N}$ is simply connected. This is called the \textbf{universal covering} of $N$ and is
        unique up to the homeomorphism. By a \textbf{deck transformation} associated with a covering map $p: M\to N$ we mean
        a continuous map $\gamma:M\to M$ which satisfies the identity $p\:\circ\:\gamma = p$, so that the diagram
        \begin{equation*}
        \begin{tikzcd}
            M \arrow[rr, "\gamma"] \arrow[dr, "p",swap]&  & M\arrow[dl, "p"]\\ 
            & N &
        \end{tikzcd}
        \end{equation*}
        is commutative.
    \end{definition}

    \newpage

    \begin{definition}
        For our purposes, the \textbf{fundamental group} $\pi_1(N)$ can be defined as the group $\Gamma$ consisting of all deck
        transformations for the universal covering $\widetilde{N}\to N$. Note that this universal covering is always a 
        \textbf{normal covering} of $N$. That is, given two points $x,x'\in M = \widetilde{N}$ with $p(x)=p(x')$, there exists
        and only one deck transformation which maps $x$ to $x'$.
    \end{definition}

    It follows that $N$ can be identified with the quotient $\nicefrac{\widetilde{N}}{\Gamma}$ of $\widetilde{N}$ by this action
    of $\Gamma$. We are finally ready to now prove the aforementioned corollary.

    \begin{proof}
        $X$ is a Riemann surface, then $\widetilde{X}$ (universal cover of $X$) is also a Riemann surface and furthermore,
        it is also simply connected. Hence,
        \[ X \simeq \frac{\widetilde{X}}{\Gamma} \]
        where $\nicefrac{\widetilde{X}}{\Gamma}$ is the collection of equivalence classes given by the relation $x\sim y$ if there
        exists $\gamma\in\Gamma$ such that $\gamma(x) = y$. Furthermore, if $x\sim y$ is given, then $p(x) = p(\gamma(x)) = p(y)$
        by definition of a deck transformation. Therefore, we have an identification $[x]\mapsto p(x)$. Finally, it is clear that
        $\Gamma <\: $Aut$(\widetilde{X})$ (i.e. $\Gamma$ is a subset of...)
    \end{proof}

    Using the corollary above, we can define the following:

    \begin{definition}
        A Riemann surface $X$ is called:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{elliptic} if $\widetilde{X} = \hat{\mathbb{C}}$ (in fact, if $\widetilde{X} = \hat{\mathbb{C}}$, then
                $X = \hat{\mathbb{C}}$,
            \item \textbf{parabolic} or sometimes \textit{flat} if $\widetilde{X} = \mathbb{C}$,
            \item \textbf{hyperbolic} if $\widetilde{X} = \mathbb{D}$
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{definition}

    We now study the spaces of all biholomorphic maps $X\to X$ ($X$ a Riemann surface). By the corollary above, we see that it
    suffices to study only the three simply connected Riemann surfaces. Denoting the set of all biholomorphic maps from $X\to X$ by
    Aut$(X)$, we are then studying the spaces: Aut$(\hat{\mathbb{C}})$, Aut$(\mathbb{D})$ and Aut$(\mathbb{C})$.\\

    We begin by studying Aut$(\hat{\mathbb{C}})$.

    \begin{theorem}
        Aut$(\hat{\mathbb{C}}) = \{$MÃ¶bius transformations$\} = \{g: g(z) = \nicefrac{az+b}{cz+d}\}$ where the coefficients are
        complex numbers with $ad-bc\neq 0$.
    \end{theorem}

    Note we can always normalize the $\nicefrac{az+b}{cz+d}$ always so that the determinant of its associated matrix
    is +1 where the resulting coefficients are well defined up to simultaenous change of sign. Therefore, Aut$(X)$ can
    be identified with the Lie group $\mathbb{PSL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ consisting of $2 \times 2$ complex matrices with determinant
    1 modulo the subgroup $\{\pm I\}$.

    \begin{proof}
        The $\implies$ direction follows from the fact that each MÃ¶bius transformation is a biholomorphic map. For the other
        direction. Now take some $f\in$ Aut$(\hat{\mathbb{C}})$ and compose it with some MÃ¶bius transformtion (already proven
        to be a subset (in fact a subgroup) of Aut$(\hat{\mathbb{C}})$) so that we may assume $f(0) = 0$ and $f(\infty) = \infty$.
        Setting $z=e^w$, it follows that the composition $w\mapsto \nicefrac{f(e^w)}{e^w}$ is a bounded holomorphic function on
        $\mathbb{C}$. Hence it takes a constant value $c$ by Liouville's Theorem. Therefore $f(z)=cw$ is linear and hence $f$
        itself an element of $\mathbb{PSL}_2(\mathbb{C})$.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{remark}
        Every MÃ¶bius transformation has 2 fixed points in $\mathbb{C}$
        \[ z = \nicefrac{az+b}{cz+d},\qquad cz^2 + (d-a)z - b = 0 \]
        This implies that there is always at least one fixed point. If $\Gamma <$ Aut$(\hat{\mathbb{C}})$ is the deck group
        then any element has no fixed point so you must have $\Gamma = \{ I \}$.
    \end{remark}

    Now, we discuss what happens in the parabolic case.

    $\Gamma <$ Aut$(\mathbb{C}) = \{z\mapsto az+b: a,b\in\mathbb{C}, a\neq 0\} = \{\text{affine transformations}\}$.
    In fact, if $a=1$, then
    \[ z = az+b \]
    has a fixed point unless $a=1$. So,
    \begin{align*}
        \Gamma &< \{z\mapsto z+b, b\in\mathbb{C}\} \\
        \Gamma &= \{I\} \\
        \Gamma &= \{I, z\mapsto z+1\}
    \end{align*}
    where then $X = \nicefrac{\mathbb{C}}{\mathbb{Z}}\simeq \mathbb{C}-\{0\}$ is the cylinder where the $\simeq$ is seen by
    \[ g(z) = e^{2\pi iz},\;g:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}-\{0\},\; g(z+1) = g(z) \]
    (Note translations preserve the Euclidean metric which has $K=0$ so the cylinder is flat)\\
    For the other cases $\mathbb{D}-\{0\}$ and $A_r = \{1<|z|<R\}$, you have two translations,
    \[ \Gamma = \langle z\mapsto z+1,z\mapsto z+\tau\rangle \]
    \[ X = \nicefrac{\mathbb{C}}{\Gamma} = \{\text{the one-holed taurus}\} \]
    Thus for each $\tau\in\mathbb{H}$ (upper half plane of $\mathbb{C}$), you get $X_{\tau} = 
    \nicefrac{\mathbb{C}}{\mathbb{Z}+\mathbb{Z}\tau}.$\\

    If $\tau' = g(\tau)$ where $g\in\mathbb{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ (special linear group), then
    \[ X_{\tau'} \simeq X_{\tau} \]
    So,
    \begin{align*}
        \wedge_{\tau} &= \mathbb{Z} + \mathbb{Z}_{\tau} \\
        g(\wedge_{\tau}) &= \wedge_{\tau}\qquad\text{if}\qquad g\in\mathbb{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})
    \end{align*}

    Thus far, we have discussed the Automorphism groups of:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item elliptic: $X = \hat{\mathbb{C}},\;$ Aut$(\hat{\mathbb{C}}) = \mathbb{PSL}_2(\mathbb{C})$.
        \item parabolic (flat): $X = \mathbb{C},\; \nicefrac{C}{\mathbb{Z}} \simeq \mathbb{C}-\{0\},\; 
                \nicefrac{C}{\mathbb{Z}+\mathbb{Z}\tau}$
    \end{enumerate}
    It is left to discuss the hyperbolic case i.e. when the curvature is $K = -1$ (in the elliptic case it was $K=1$ and $K=0$
    in the flat case).\\

    First, we show that there is a hyperbolic holomorphism between $\mathbb{D}$ and $\mathbb{H}$ by explicitly constructing one.
    Claim that it is given by
    \[ \mathbb{H}\to \mathbb{D},\qquad z\mapsto \frac{z-c}{z+c} \]
    Therefore, it suffices to find Aut$(\mathbb{H})$ since from above it follows Aut$(\mathbb{H})=$ Aut$(\mathbb{D})$\\
    Claim:
    \[ \text{Aut}(\mathbb{H}) = \{z\mapsto\frac{az+b}{cz+d}: a,b,c,d\in\mathbb{R}, ad-bc=1\} \simeq \mathbb{PSL}_2(\mathbb{R}) \]
    \begin{proof}
        Choose $g\in\mathbb{PSL}_2(\mathbb{R})$ so $g(\mathbb{H})\subseteq \mathbb{H}$. Note:
        \begin{align*}
            \text{Im}(\frac{az+b}{cd+d}) &=\:\text{Im}(\frac{(az+b)(c\overline{z}+d)}{|cz+d|^2} \\
            &= \text{Im}(\frac{a|z|^2+bd+adz+bc\overline{z}}{|cz+d|^2}) \\
            &= \frac{ad\text{Im}(z)-bc\text{Im}(z)}{|cz+d|^2} = \frac{\text{Im}(z)}{|cz+d|^2} > 0
        \end{align*}
    \end{proof}

    Why aren't there any others?
    \begin{proof}
        For any $z\in\mathbb{H}$, there is $g\in\mathbb{PSL}_2(\mathbb{R})$ such that $g(z) = i$.\\
        Given $g\in$ Aut$(\mathbb{H})$ such that $g(i) = i$, is $g\in\mathbb{PSL}_2(\mathbb{R})$?
    \end{proof}

    Now, we recall:
    \begin{lemma}[Schwarz Lemma]
        If $g:\mathbb{D}\to\mathbb{D}$ is holomorphic and $g(0)=0$, then $|g(z)| \leq |z|$ for any $z\in\mathbb{D}$ and if
        there exists $z\neq 0$ with $|g(z)|=|z|$, then:
        \[ \exists\; \theta\;\text{such that}\; g(z) = e^{i\theta}z \]
    \end{lemma}

    We can interpret this to mean that if $g$ preserves norm, it is a rotation, otherwise it retracts

    \begin{proof}
        $f(z) = \nicefrac{g(z)}{z}$ is holomorphic. Hence by maxmium principle, if $|z|\leq r<1$,
        \[ |f(z)| \leq\:\text{max}_{|z|=r} |f(z)| \leq \nicefrac{1}{r} \to 1 \]
        By maximum principle, if there exists $z$ such that $|\nicefrac{f(z)}{z} = 1$, then
        \[ \nicefrac{f(z)}{z} = c = e^{i\theta} \]
    \end{proof}

    \begin{corollary}
        If $g:\mathbb{D}\to\mathbb{D}$, $g(0)=0$, then $|g'(0)|\leq 1$. If $|g'(0)|=1$, then $g$ is a rotation.
    \end{corollary}

    \begin{corollary}
        If $g\in$ Aut$(\mathbb{D})$ and $g(0)=0$, then $g(z) = e^{i\theta}z$.
    \end{corollary}
    \begin{proof}
        Choose $g\in$ Aut$(\mathbb{D})$, then there exists $h$ such that $g\circ h =$ id.
    \end{proof}

    Given $g\in$ Aut$(\mathbb{H})$ such that $g(i) = i$, then
    \[ g(z) = \frac{z\cos{\theta}+\sin{\theta}}{-z\sin{\theta}+\cos{\theta}} \]
    For example, $\theta = \nicefrac{\pi}{2}$, then $g(z) = -\nicefrac{1}{z}$. On the Hyperbolic plane, one can imagine
    such mappings $g$ as a rotation around $z=i$.\\

    Thus,
    \begin{align*}
        \text{Aut}(\mathbb{H}) &= \{z\mapsto \frac{az+b}{cz+d}:a,b,c,d\in\mathbb{R},ad-bc=1\} \\
        \text{Aut}(\mathbb{D}) &= \{z\mapsto e^{i\theta}\frac{z-a}{1-z\overline{a}},|a|<1,0\leq\theta<2\pi\}
    \end{align*}
    Note, if $f(z) = \nicefrac{z-a}{1-z\overline{a}}$, then $f(f(z)) = z$.\\

    \section{Hyperbolic Metric}

    \begin{theorem}
        There exists up to scaling, a \textit{unique} Riemann metric on $\mathbb{H}$ (or $\mathbb{D}$) which is invariant by 
        Aut$(\mathbb{H})$. In formulas, it is given by:
        \[ ds = \frac{dz}{y} \]
        where $dz$ is the Euclidean metric and $y$ is the imaginary point.
    \end{theorem}

    In the Hyperbolic plane, we can imagine the distance between two points connected by a horizontal line becoming very big
    as it (the horizontal line) approaches Im$(z) = 0$ and very small as it moves away.\\

    The mapping
    \[ z\mapsto z+1 \]
    preserves $ds$. The mapping
    \[ z\mapsto \lambda z \]
    preserves $ds$ if $\lambda>1$.\\

    For $\mathbb{D}$, the Hyperbolic metric is given by
    \[ ds = \frac{2dz}{1-|z|^2} \]
    We want to normalize this so $K=-1$.

    \begin{remark}
        If $U\subsetneq \mathbb{C}$ is open, simply connected, there exists a biholomorphic mapping
        \[ f: U\to \mathbb{D} \]
        which defines the \textbf{hyperbolic metric} (PoincarÃ© metric) on $U$
        \[ \rho_U = f_{\rho_\mathbb{D}} \]
        so,
        \[ ds_U \approx \frac{dz}{d(z,\partial U}) \]
    \end{remark}

    \section{Hyperbolic Riemann surfaces}

    Recall the classifications of Riemann surfaces:
    \[ X = \frac{\widetilde{X}}{\Gamma},\qquad \Gamma <\:\text{Aut}(\widetilde{X}),\qquad \widetilde{X} = \hat{\mathbb{C}},\mathbb{C},
        \mathbb{D}\simeq \mathbb{H} \]
    where $\Gamma$ is discrete torsion free. In the elliptic case (spherical, positive $K$):
    \[ \text{Aut}(X) = \mathbb{C} \]
    In the parabolic case (i.e. Euclidean/flat with $K=0$), we have
    \[ X = \mathbb{C},\nicefrac{\mathbb{C}}{\mathbb{Z}},\nicefrac{\mathbb{C}}{\wedge} \]

    We have the following \textit{fact}: If $X$ is a Riemann surfaces and $X\neq\hat{\mathbb{C}},\mathbb{C},\mathbb{C}-\{0\},
    \nicefrac{\mathbb{C}}{\wedge}$, then $\widetilde{X} = \mathbb{H}$. Note $\wedge =$ torus, $\mathbb{Z} + \mathbb{Z}\tau$.\\

    \begin{corollary}
        A Riemann surface $X$ such that $\widetilde{X} \simeq \mathbb{H}$ is called \textbf{Hyperbolic} and it carries a natural
        metric $\rho$ of constant negative curvature. This is called the \textbf{PoincarÃ© metric}.
    \end{corollary}

    \begin{theorem}
        The upper half plane $\mathbb{H}$ carries a unique, up to scaling, Riemannian metric which is invariant by
        \[ \text{Aut}(\mathbb{H}) \simeq \mathbb{PSL}_2(\mathbb{R}) \]
    \end{theorem}

    First, we prove the corollary.

    \begin{proof}
        Note, $X \simeq \nicefrac{\widetilde{X}}{\Gamma} \simeq \nicefrac{\mathbb{H}}{\Gamma}$.\\
        Since The Hyperbolic metric is $\Gamma$-invariant, it defines a metric on $\widetilde{X} = \nicefrac{\mathbb{H}}{\Gamma}$.
    \end{proof}

    Before we prove the theorem, we remark:
    \begin{remark}
        In general, a Riemannian metric is given by
        \[ ds^2 = g_{11}dx^2 + 2g_{12}dxdy + g_{22}dy^2 \]
        A \textbf{conformal} metric on $X$ is given by
        \[ ds = \rho(z)dz \]
        where $\rho: X\to\mathbb{R}^{\geq 0}$ (Hyperbolic metric is conformal).
    \end{remark}

    \begin{proof}
        Note, $y =$ Im$(z)$ and $\rho = \nicefrac{|dz|}{y}$.\\
        Look at $g(z) = \nicefrac{az+b}{cz+d}$ for $a,b,c,d\in\mathbb{R}$:
        \[ g'(z) = \frac{[a(cz+d)-c(az+b)]}{(cz+d)^2} = \frac{ad-bc}{(cz+d)^2} = \frac{1}{(cz+d)^2} \]
        and,
        \begin{align*}
            \text{Im}(g(z)) =\:\text{Im}(\frac{az+b}{cz+d}) &=\:\text{Im}(\frac{(az+b)(c\overline{z}+d)}{|cz+d|^2}) \\
            &=\:\text{Im}(\frac{bc\overline{z}+adz}{|cz+d|^2}) = \frac{bc}{|cz+d|^2}\text{Im}(\overline{z}) + 
                \frac{ad\text{Im}(z)}{|cz+a|^2} \\
            &= \frac{\text{Im}(z)}{|cz+d|^2}
        \end{align*}
        So,
        \[ z' = g(z),\quad |dz| = |g'(z)|dz,\quad \frac{|dz|}{y'} = \frac{|g'(z)||dz|}{\text{Im}(g(z))} = \frac{dz}{\text{Im}(z)} \]
        For uniqueness:\\
        Suppose the conformal metric $\rho(z)dz$ is $\mathbb{PSL}_2(\mathbb{R})$-invariant. Then, it is invariant by $f(z)=bz+a$
        so,
        \[ z' = f(z) \qquad \rho(z')dz' = \rho(f(z))|f'(z)|dz \stackrel{?}{=} \rho(z)dz \]
        Note, at $z=i$:
        \[ \rho(f(z)) = \frac{\rho(z)}{|f'(z)|},\qquad \rho(a+ib) = \frac{\rho(i)}{b} \]
        Hence, if we normalize so that $\rho(i) = i$, then $\rho(z) = \nicefrac{1}{\rho(\text{Im}(z))}$.\\

        What if it is not conformal?\\
        A Riemannian metric on $\mathbb{H}$ which is invariant must, by Aut$(\mathbb{H})$, be conformal. Note,
        \[ g(z) = \frac{\cos({\theta})z-\sin{\theta}}{z\sin{\theta}+\cos{\theta}} \]
        rotates around $z=i$. More percisely, $g(i) = i$, and $dg_i$ acts as a rotation aon $T_i(\mathbb{H})$ (tangent plane).\\
        Hence the metric induced by $\rho$ on $T_i(\mathbb{H})$ is a multiple of the Euclidean metric since it is rotationally invariant.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{lemma}
        The disk $\mathbb{D}$ with the Hyperbolic metric is \textbf{complete}. Moreover, any path leading from $z_0\in\mathbb{D}$ to 
        a point $\partial{\mathbb{D}}$ has infinite length. Any two points of $\mathbb{D}$ one joined by unique geodesics of minimal
        length.\\
        In the disk model, geodesics are arcs of circles which are orthogonal to $\partial{\mathbb{D}}$.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        Take $\mathbb{H}$ as model.\\
        Note, given $z_1,z_2$ acting on Aut$(\mathbb{H})$, you can assume
        \[ \text{Re}(z_1) =\:\text{Re}(z_2). \]
        In the case of the vertical geodesic (the shortest line connecting two points is a vertical, straight line), we have
        \[ \rho = \frac{|dz|}{y},\qquad ds^2 = \frac{dx^2+dy^2}{y^2} \]
        So, the projection any path $\gamma$ between $z_1,z_2$ of $[z_1,z_2]$ is shorter. The lenght is,
        \[ d_{\mathbb{H}}(z_1,z_2) = \int_{y_1}^{y_2} \frac{1}{y}dy = \log{\frac{z_2}{z_1}},\qquad y_i =\:\text{Im}(z_i) \]
        The other case occurs when the geodesic between two points is an arc segment.\\
        Why is it complete?\\
        If $(z_n)$ is Cauchy, then $d_{\mathbb{H}}(z_n,z_0) \leq \mathcal{C}$.\\
        Since $\rho(z)\to\infty$ as $z\to\partial{\mathbb{H}}$, then $d_{\mathbb{H}}(z_n,z_0)\leq\mathcal{C}\implies z_n$ converges.
    \end{proof}

    Another \textit{fact}:\\

    If $U\subsetneq\mathbb{C}$ is simply connected, open with the PoincarÃ© metric $\rho_n$, then:
    \[ \rho_U(z) \approx \frac{\rho_E(z)}{d(z,\partial{U})} \]

    \begin{lemma}[Schawrz-Pick-Ahlfors Lemma]
        If $S,T$ are Hyperbolic Riemannian surfaces, then any holomorphic map $f: S\to T$ is a (weak) contraction for the PoinarÃ©
        metrics on $S$ and $T$, i.e.
        \[ \rho_T(f(z),f(w)) \leq \rho_S(z,w) \qquad \forall\;z,w\in S \]
        If equality holds for some $z\neq w$, then $f$ is a local isometry.
    \end{lemma}

    We recall the following before proving this:
    \begin{align*}
        |f'(z)|\leq 1,\qquad f:\mathbb{D}\to\mathbb{D},\;f(0)=0 \\
        \rho_{\mathbb{H}} = \frac{|dz|}{y}
    \end{align*}
    At $z=i$, the two metrics infinitisemally the same.

    \begin{proof}
        \begin{equation*}
            \begin{tikzcd}
                \tilde{S} \arrow{r}{\tilde{f}} \arrow{d} & \tilde{T} \arrow{d} \\
                S \arrow{r}{f} & T
            \end{tikzcd}
        \end{equation*}
        where $\tilde{S}=\mathbb{H}$ and $\tilde{T}=\mathbb{H}$ so that $\widetilde{f}: \mathbb{H}\to\mathbb{H}$ is 
        a weak contraction in the Hyperbolic metric.\\

        By the Schwarz lemma, if $\widetilde{f}$ preserves a point i.e. $f(i)=i$, $\widetilde{f}$ is a weak contraction in the
        Euclidean metric and $z=i$, but Euclidean and Hyperbolic metrics coincide on $T_i(\mathbb{H})$, hence by invariance, it is
        a contraction on every $T_z(\mathbb{H})$.
    \end{proof}

    \section{Week 3}

    The following is known as Littlewood's Conjecture (it is an open problem).
    \begin{theorem}
        For all $\alpha,\beta\in\mathbb{R}$:
        \[ \liminf_{n\to\infty} n\norm{n\alpha}\norm{n\beta} = 0,\qquad \norm{x} = d(x,\mathbb{Z}) \]
    \end{theorem}

    So far, it has been shown that:
    \begin{theorem}[Einsiedter, Katok, Lindenstrauss]
        The set of exceptions has Hausdorff dimension 0.
    \end{theorem}

    Recall the classification of Riemann surfaces:\\

    Any $X$ which is a Riemannian surface is of type $X=\nicefrac{\widetilde{X}}{\Gamma}$ where,
    \[ \widetilde{X} = \hat{\mathbb{C}},\mathbb{C}\;\text{or}\;\mathbb{D} \]
    with $\Gamma <$ Aut$(\widetilde{X})$ where $\Gamma$ is discrete and fixed point free.\\

    Hence:\\
    \[ X = \hat{\mathbb{C}} \]
    \[ X = \mathbb{C}, X\simeq \nicefrac{\mathbb{C}}{\mathbb{Z}}, X\simeq \frac{\mathbb{C}}{\mathbb{Z}+\mathbb{Z}\tau} \]
    In any other case, $X\simeq \mathbb{D}\simeq \mathbb{H}$ and
    \[ \Gamma <\;\text{Aut}(\mathbb{H}) = \mathbb{PSL}_2(\mathbb{R}) \]

    Every Hyperbolic Riemannian surface is endowed with a PoincarÃ© metric of constant negative curvature.\\

    A different proof of the Schwarz-Pick-Ahlfors lemma.

    \begin{lemma}[Schwarz, Pick, Ahlfors]
        If $f:S\to S'$ is holomorphic between two Hyperbolic Riemannian surfaces, then
        \[ d_{\rho_S'}(f(z),f(w)) \leq d_{\rho_S}(z,w)\qquad \forall\;z,w\in S\]
        If equality holds for some $z\neq w$, then $f$ is a local isometry.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        Lift $f$ to,
        \begin{equation*}
        \begin{tikzcd}
            \widetilde{S} \arrow{r}{\widetilde{f}} \arrow{d} & \widetilde{S'} \arrow{d} \\
             S \arrow{r}{f} & S'
        \end{tikzcd}
        \end{equation*}
        where $\widetilde{S}\simeq \mathbb{D}$ and $\widetilde{S'}\simeq \mathbb{D}$. Pick $z\in S$, 
        lift $\widetilde{z}\in \widetilde{S}$

        \begin{center}
            \includegraphics[scale=0.05]{IMG_1016}
        \end{center}
        Then $g = g_2\circ \widetilde{f} \circ g_1^{-1}$ maps $\mathbb{D}\to\mathbb{D}$, $O\to O$.\\

        Hence,
        \[ \norm{d_{g_{E,0}}}\leq 1, \qquad \text{by Schwarz lemma} \]
        where $\norm{d_{g_{E,0}}} = \norm{d\widetilde{f}_{\mathbb{H},\widetilde{z}}}$.\\

        Note: 
        \[ \rho_{\mathbb{D}} = \frac{2|dz|}{1-|z|^2} \simeq 2|dz| \simeq 2\rho_{\mathbb{E}} \]
    \end{proof}

    Examples of Hyperbolic Riemannian surfaces.\\

    1. $X=\mathbb{H},\Gamma = \{z\mapsto \nicefrac{az+b}{cz+d}\}, g(z) = z+1, X = \nicefrac{\mathbb{H}}{z\sim z+1}$.\\
    This forms a cylinder in $\mathbb{H}$ but this is not the same as the cylinder in the Euclidean plane as this Hyperbolic
    one is not locally flat. Recall, $\rho_{\mathbb{H}} = \nicefrac{d|z|}{\eta}$. So, in the Hyperbolic plane, this looks like
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[scale=0.05]{IMG_1017}
    \end{center}
    and can be imagined as:
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[scale=0.05]{IMG_1018}
    \end{center}
    This is topologically a cylinder but looks very different. Recall, we saw $\nicefrac{\mathbb{C}}{\mathbb{Z}}\simeq\mathbb{C}-\{0\}$
    by exp: $\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}-\{0\}$. This is not Hyperbolic but has similar construction.
    \begin{align*}
        g(z) = e^{2\pi iz},\qquad g:\mathbb{H}\to\mathbb{D}-\{0\} := \mathbb{D}^* \\
        e^{|2\pi iz|} = e^{\text{Re}|2\pi iz} = e^{-\text{Im}(2\pi z)}
    \end{align*}
    So, $\nicefrac{\mathbb{H}}{\mathbb{Z}} \simeq \mathbb{D}^*$.\\

    2. $g(z) = \lambda z, (\lambda > 1), \nicefrac{H}{z\sim\lambda z}$:
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[scale=0.05]{IMG_1019}
    \end{center}
    Note the length of the line segment from $\lambda i$ to $i$ is given by $\int_i^{\lambda i} \frac{dy}{y} = \log{\lambda}$. It
    is also worth noting that length of line segments closer to Im$(z)= 0$ become very big. We can visualise the diagram above as:
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[scale=0.05]{IMG_1020}
    \end{center}
    Where the length of the center in the middle is $\log{\lambda}$.\\

    This is similar to $A_R$, and is actually biholomorphic to this. Note:
    \[ A_R = \{1 < |z| < R\} \]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[scale=0.05]{IMG_1021}
    \end{center}
    The map is:
    \[ z\mapsto\;\exp(2\pi i\frac{\log z}{\log \lambda}) \]
    \begin{align*}
        \frac{\log{\lambda z}}{\log{\lambda}} &= \frac{\log{\lambda}} + \log{z}{\log{\lambda}} \\
        &= \frac{\log{z}}{\log{\lambda}}+1
    \end{align*}
    Now, find the image of the map of the right side of the first diagram:
    \begin{align*}
        g_{\lambda}: \frac{\mathbb{H}}{\mathbb{Z}\to\lambda z}\to \mathbb{C} \\
        g_{\lambda}([1,\lambda]) = \{z: |z|=1\} = S^1
    \end{align*}
    Now the question is to see what the other side of the first diagram maps to.
    \begin{align*}
        g_{\lambda}([-\lambda,-1]) &=\\
        z = &-t, t\in[1,\lambda],\nicefrac{\log z}{\log \lambda} = \frac{\log t + \pi i}{\log \lambda} \\
        g_{\lambda}(z) = &\exp(2\pi \frac{\pi i + \log t}{\log \lambda}) = \exp(\frac{-2\pi^2}{\log \lambda})
        \exp(\frac{2\pi i\log t}{\log \lambda})
    \end{align*}
    so that $R = \exp(\nicefrac{2\pi^2}{\log{\lambda}})$.\\

    So, we know what happens at:
    \[ \hat{\mathbb{C}},\mathbb{C} = \hat{\mathbb{C}} - \{\infty\}, \mathbb{C}^* = \hat{\mathbb{C}}-\{0,\infty\} \]
    By exclusion,
    \[ \hat{\mathbb{C}}-\{0,1,\infty\} \]
    is a Hyperbolic Riemann surface.\\

    \begin{corollary}[Little Picard Theorem]
        A holomorphic map from $\mathbb{C}$ to $\mathbb{C}-\{0,1\}$ must be constant.
    \end{corollary}
    \begin{proof}
        \begin{equation*}
            \begin{tikzcd}
                \mathbb{C} \arrow[rr, "\tilde{f}"] \arrow[dr, "f",swap]&  & \mathbb{D}\arrow[dl, ""]\\ 
            & \mathbb{C}-\{0,1\} &
            \end{tikzcd}
        \end{equation*}
    \end{proof}

    \begin{theorem}[Picard]
        A holomorphic function $f:\mathbb{D}-\{0\}\to\mathbb{C}-\{0,1\}$ cannot have an essential singularity $z=0$.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        The diagram here attempts to represent the process in the paragraph below.
        \begin{center}
            \includegraphics[scale=0.05]{IMG_1023}
        \end{center}
        Pick a loop around 0. Then, the length of the loop must be shorter than the one in the image.\\
        The image must go to 0,1 or $\infty$. Otherwise, the length is too long. If it goes to $\infty$, it has a pole. If not, it
        has a hole that can be filled.
    \end{proof}

    We now begin discussion on Fatou and Julia sets.

    \section{Montel's Theorem}

    \begin{definition}
        Let $S$ and $S'$ be Riemann surfaces.
        A family $\mathfrak{F}$ of holomorphic functions $f:S\to S'$ (with $S'$ compact) is \textbf{normal} if every sequence
        of functions in $\mathfrak{F}$ which converge uniformily on compact sets. Note: the limit of such sequences is holomorphic.
    \end{definition}

    If $S'$ is non-compact:

    \begin{definition}
        A collection $\mathcal{F}$ of maps from a Riemann surface $S$ to a (possibly noncompact) Riemann surface $T$ will be called
        \textbf{normal} if every infinite sequence of maps from $\mathcal{F}$ contains either a subsequence which converges locally
        uniformily or a subsequence which diverges locally uniformaly from $T$.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{theorem}[Montel's theorem]
        If $S$ is a Riemann surface and $S'\subseteq\hat{\mathbb{C}}-\{0,1,\infty\}$, then every family of holomorphic functions
        $f: S\to S'$ is normal.
    \end{theorem}

    \begin{remark}
        A limit $g$ of such convergent family need not take values in $S'$.
    \end{remark}

    \begin{proof}
        Recall, any Riemann surface has a countable dense subset $(z_j)_{j\in\mathbb{N}}\subseteq S$,
        \begin{center}
            \includegraphics[scale=0.05]{IMG_1024}
        \end{center}
        For each $j$, $(f_n(z_j))_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\subseteq\hat{\mathbb{C}}$. Hence, there is a subsequence $f_{n_1}(z_1)\to w_1\in
        \overline{S'}$.\\

        Now, consider $(f_{n_2}(z_2))_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\subseteq\hat{\mathbb{C}}$, hence there is a subsequence 
        $f_{n,2}(z_2)\to w_2\in\hat{\mathbb{C}}$. Hence by taking diagonal, there is a subsequence $g_n\in\mathfrak{F}$, such that
        $g_n(z_j) \to w_j$ for all $j$ as $n\to\infty$. We then have two cases, either $w_1\in S'$ or $w_1\in\partial{S'}-S'$.

        Case 1: $w_1\in S'$.\\
        Pick a compact set $K\subseteq S$ and $\epsilon>0$. Choose $z_1,\hdots,z_n\in K$ such that
        \[ K \subseteq \cup_{i=1}^N B(z_i,\epsilon) \]
        By construction of $(g_n)$, there exists $n_0$ such that for all $m,n > n_0$,
        \[ d_{S'}(g_n(z_i),g_m(z_i)) < \epsilon \]
        for all $i = 1,\hdots,N$ where $d_{S'}$ is the PoincarÃ© metric. Hence, if $z\in K$, there exists $i$ such that
        \[ d_{S'}(z,z_i)<\epsilon \]
        and
        \begin{align*}
            d_{S'}(g_n(z),g_m(z)) &\leq d_{S'}(g_n(z),g_n(z_i)) + d_{S'}(g_n(z_i),g_m(z_i)) + d_{S'}(g_m(z_i),g_m(z)) \\
            &\leq d_{S'}(z,z_i) + d_{S'}(z_i,z) \leq 3\epsilon
        \end{align*}

        Case 2: $w_1\in \partial{S'}{S'}$.\\
        $g_n(z_1)\to w_1\in \partial{S'}{S'}$. Pick $K\subseteq S$ compact, then there exists $\mathcal{C}>0$ such that
        $d_{S'}(g_n(z),g_n(z_1)) < \mathcal{C}$ for all $z\in K$, for all $n$. Hence, for each $z\in K$, then
        \[ \lim_{n\to\infty} g_n(z) = w_1 \]
    \end{proof}

    \begin{lemma}
        If $S'$ is hyperbolic $\subseteq \hat{\mathbb{C}}$ and $z_k\to z_{\infty}\in \partial{S'}$, then for each $\epsilon>0$
        \[ N_{\rho_{S'}}(z_k,\epsilon) \to z_{\infty} \]
        as $k\to\infty$.
    \end{lemma}

    \subsection{Julia and Fatou Sets}

    We consider rational maps $f(z)=p(z)/q(z)$ without common factors. Such a map can be considered as a dynamical system
    on the sphere $f:\hat{\mathbb{C}}\to\hat{\mathbb{C}}$.

    \begin{definition}
        deg$f$ = max$\{$deg$p$,deg$q\}$.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{remark}
        Note: If $f:\hat{\mathbb{C}}\to\hat{\mathbb{C}}$ is rational, then for $z\in\hat{\mathbb{C}}$:
        \[ \#f^{-1}(z) =\:\text{deg}f \]
        except for finitely many values of $z$.
    \end{remark}

    \begin{proof}
        $f^{-1}(z) = \{w\in\hat{\mathbb{C}}:p(w)/q(w) = z\} = \{w:p(z)-zq(w)=0\}$ which is a polynomial of degree
        max$\{$deg$p$,deg$q\}$.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{definition}[Fatou Set]
        A point $z\in\hat{\mathbb{C}}$ lies in the \textbf{Fatou set} $\Omega(f)$ if there exists an open set $U$ with $z\in U$,
        then $(f^n|_U)_{n\geq 0}$ is normal where $f^n$ is the $n$-fold iterate i.e. the Fatou set is the domain of normality
        for the collection of iterates $\{f^n\}$. We can also say that the Fatou set of $f$ is the largest open subset of
        $\hat{\mathbb{C}}$ on which the family $\{f^n\}_{n\geq 0}$ is equicontinuous at every point. We can think of this as
        saying that any orbit which starts near $z_0$ remains \say{close} to $z_0$ as it iterates.
    \end{definition}

    The \textbf{Julia set} $J(f)$ is the complement of the Fatou set and can be thought of as the set of points of which the orbits
    exhibit \say{sensitive dependence on initial conditions} \footnote{Holomorphic Dynamics and Hyperbolic Geometry by Shaun Bullett}.

    \begin{example}
        Let $f:\hat{\mathbb{C}}\to\hat{\mathbb{C}}$ with $f(z) = z^2$.\\

        Then $f(0) = 0$ with $f'(0) = 0$ so that $f^n(z) = z^{2^n}$. Thus, if $|z|<1$, then $\lim_n f^n(z) = 0$. Therefore,
        $\mathbb{D}$ is inside the Fatou set, i.e. $\mathbb{D}\subset\Omega(f)$.\\

        If $|z|>1$, then $\lim_{n\to\infty} |f^n(z)| = \pm\infty$ so that $\{z:|z|>1\}\subseteq\Omega(f)$ and finally,
        $J(f) = \{z: |z|=1\}$.
    \end{example}

    \begin{remark}
        By definition of the Fatou set, it is open and so the Julia set is closed.
    \end{remark}

    We now ask if $J(f) = \emptyset$ or if $\Omega(f)=\emptyset$. The answer is that if deg$f\geq 2$, then $J(f)\neq\emptyset$. A
    proof of this can be found in [1] 
    
    \begin{remark}
        There exist rational maps $f$ with $J(f) = \hat{\mathbb{C}}$ (see $z\mapsto (z^2+1)/4z(z^2-1)$)\footnote{LattÃ¨s 1918} but
        if $f$ is to be say polynomial then $\infty\in \Omega(f)$ always.
    \end{remark}

    We can also ask if $J(f)$ is connected or more generally what is its topology.

    \begin{definition}[Mandelbrot Set]
        The Mandelbrot set is the set of values of $c$ in the complex plane for which the orbit of 0 under iteration of the rational
        map $z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c$ remains bounded. Equivalently,
        \[ \mathcal{M} = \{c\in\mathbb{C}: J(z^2+c)\;\text{is connected}\} \]
    \end{definition}

    \begin{lemma}
        Both Fatou and Julia sets are fully invariant. This is to say,
        \[ f^{-1}(J(f)) = J(f) \]
        and
        \[ f^{-1}(\Omega(f)) = \Omega(f) \]
        This implies $f(J)\subseteq J$ and $f(\Omega)\subseteq \Omega$.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        It suffices to show the Fatou set is invariant. Furthermore, we have $(f^{n+1}|_V)_{n\geq 0}$ is normal if and only if
        $(f^n|_U)_{n\geq 0}$ is invariant since for any open set $U\subseteq\hat{\mathbb{C}}$, some sequence of iterates $f^{n_j}$
        converges uniformily on compact subsets of $U$ if and only if the corresponding sequence of iterates $f^{n_j+1}$ converges
        uniformily on compact subsets of the open set $V = f^{-1}(U)$.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{lemma}
        $J(f^n) = J(f)$ for all $n\geq 1$ and $\Omega(f^n) = \Omega(f)$.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        As before, it suffices to show that $\Omega(f^n) = \Omega(f)$. It suffices to note that $(f^{k_n})_k$ is normal implies
        $(f^{k_n+h})_k$ is normal for $h=0,\hdots,n-1$ and $(f^{k_n})_k$ normal implies $(f^{k_n+1})_k$ normal.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{definition}
        Consider a \textbf{periodic orbit} or \textbf{cycle}
        \[ f: z_0\mapsto z_1\mapsto \hdots \mapsto z_{m-1} \mapsto z_m = z_0 \]
        for a holomorphic map $f:\hat{\mathbb{C}}\to\hat{\mathbb{C}}$. The smallest $n$ such that $f^n(z)=z$ is the \textbf{period}
        of $z$. The \textbf{multiplier} is the number $\lambda:= (f^n)'(z)$. The cycle is called:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{attracting} if $|\lambda|<1$; \textbf{superattracting} if $\lambda =0$.
            \item \textbf{repelling} if $|\lambda|\geq 1$
            \item \textbf{indifferent} if $|\lambda| = 1$
            \item \textbf{parabolic} if $|\lambda|=1$ but no iteration $f^n$ is the identity map
        \end{enumerate}
        Attracting and superattracting cycles are in the Fatou set, i.e. $z\in\Omega(f)$. Repelling, indifferent cycles and
        parabolic cycles are in the Julia set.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}[Grand Orbit]
        Given $z\in\hat{\mathbb{C}}$, for $f:\hat{\mathbb{C}}\to\hat{\mathbb{C}}$, the \textbf{grand orbit} is
        \[ GO(z,f) = \{w:\exists\;n,m\geq 0\;\text{such that}\;f^n(w)=f^m(z)\} \]
        Equivalently, we can say that the grand orbit of a point $z$ under $f$, we mean a set $GO(z,f)$ consisting
        of all points $z\in\hat{\mathbb{C}}$ whose orbits intersect the orbit of $z$.
    \end{definition}

    Note: if $z\in J(f)$, then $GO(z,f)\subseteq J(f)$.

    \begin{definition}
        The \textbf{basin of attraction} of an attracting periodic point $z_0$ of period $p$ is defined to be the set
        \[ \mathcal{A}=\{z\in\hat{\mathbb{C}}: f^{p}(z),f^{2p}(z),f^{3p}(z),\hdots\;\text{converges to some point in the 
                orbit of}\;z_0\} \]
    \end{definition}

    \begin{theorem}
        Every attracting periodic orbit is in the Fatou set. In fact, the entire basin of attraction
        $\mathcal{A}$ for an attracting periodic orbit is contained in the Fatou set. However, the boundary of the
        basin lies in the Julia set.
    \end{theorem}

    \begin{proof}
        Suppose $p$ is the period. Consider $(f^{pn})_{n\geq 0}$. If $z$ is a periodic point, then $|(f^p)'(z)|<1$. Hence
        for $z'$ close to $z$, we have $(f^{pn})(z')\to z$ by Banach fixed point theorem.
        If $z\in\partial{U}$, then $f^{pz}|_U\to z_0$ the fixed point. If $z$ is in the boundary, i.e. if $z\in\partial{U}$, then
        $f^{pn}\not\to z_0$. Hence the family $(f^{pn})$ is not normal at $z$, because if we want existence, then it would be
        discontinuous. One part approaches 0, and the other, $\infty$.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{lemma}
        If $z$ is a repelling periodic point, then it lies in the Julia set.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        Suppose $p = 1$. Then $f(z_0) = z_0$ and $\lambda = |f'(z_0)| > 1$. If $z\in\Omega(f)$, then $f^n|_U$ is normal so 
        $f^{nk}|_U \to g: U \to \hat{\mathbb{C}}$ is holomorphic.\\
        Hence, $(f^{nk})'|_U \to g'$. This is a contradiction because
        \[ |(f^n)'(z_0)| = |\lambda^n| \to \infty \]
    \end{proof}

    \begin{lemma}
        Parabolic periodic points lie in the Julia set.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        Assume $f(z_0) = 0$, $f'(z_0) = 1$. If you expand $f$ in power series near $z_0$, $f(w) = w + a_kw^k + a_{k+1}w^{k+1}+\hdots$\\
        Hence, $f^p$ correspods to the power series $w\mapsto w+a_kw^k + O(w^{k+1})$ and so $f^{pk}$ corresponds to the power
        series $w \mapsto w + ka_qw^q + \hdots$. Thus the $q$th derivative of $f^{pk}$ at 0 equal $q!ka_q$ which diverges to infinity as
        $k\to\infty$. Since no subsequences $f^{pk_j}$ can converge locally uniformily as $k_j\to\infty$, we are done.
    \end{proof}

    Now, we cover dynamics on Riemann surfaces other than $\hat{\mathbb{C}}$ and we start with the Euclidean case.

    \subsection{Dynamics on Euclidean Surfaces}

    $\mathbb{C}$ has hard dynamics since we are not only dealing with polynomial maps but transcendental ones as well.\\

    For the $\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{C}/wedge$ (Cylinder and Torus) case, we have the theorem:

    \begin{theorem}
        Every holomorphic function $f: \mathbb{C}/\wedge \to \mathbb{C}/\wedge$ is of the form $f(z) = \alpha z + c$ 
        (mod $\wedge$), with degree of $f$ being $d = |\alpha|^2$. The Julia set if $|\alpha|\leq 1$ is the empty set and if
        $|\alpha|>1$ is equal to $\mathbb{C}/\wedge$.
    \end{theorem}

    In particular, $|\alpha|^2\in\mathbb{N}$. In fact, if $|\alpha|\neq 1$, then $\alpha$ must be a root of
    $\alpha^2 + p\alpha + d = 0$, then $p,d\in\mathbb{Z}$, $p^2 < 4d$, $d = |\alpha|^2$.\\

    Such lattices $\wedge$ are said to have complex multiplication. This is important for number theory.
    
    \begin{proof}
        Pick $\wedge$ so that the lattice $\wedge\subset\mathbb{C}$ is spanned by two numbers 1 and non-real $\tau$. Lift
        $f:\mathbb{C}/\wedge\to\mathbb{C}/\wedge$ to a holomorphic map $F:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}$ on the universal covering surface.
        Then, for all $z\in\mathbb{C}$:
         \[ F(z+1) - F(z) = \alpha\in\wedge\quad\text{otherwise it is not commutative} \]
         which implies,
         \[ F(z+\tau) - F(z) = \beta\in\wedge \]
         Consider: $G(z) = F(z) - \alpha z$. Then,
         \[ g(z+1) = F(z+1) - \alpha z - \alpha = F(z) - \alpha z = g(z) \]
         and,
         \[ g(z+\tau) = F(z+\tau) - \alpha z - \alpha\tau = F(z) + \beta - \alpha z - \alpha z = g(z) + (\beta - \alpha z) \]
         so we get a function
         \[ g: \mathbb{C}/\wedge \to \mathbb{C}/[\mathbb{Z}(\beta-\alpha\tau)] \]
         Then either,
         \[ \beta - \alpha\tau = 0,\quad g:\mathbb{C}/\wedge \to\mathbb{C}\;\text{or}\; \beta-\alpha\tau\neq 0\quad g:\mathbb{C}/\wedge\to
             \mathbb{C}/\wedge \]
         Remember $\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{Z}$ is compact, so by the open mapping theorem, $g(\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{Z})$ is compact and open
         in $\mathbb{C}$. Thus $g$ must be constant and so,
         \[ g(z) = F(z) - \alpha z \equiv c \]
         Note if $\alpha\neq 1$, then
         \[ f(z) = \alpha z + c = z \]
         has a fixed point at $z_0 = c/(1-\alpha)$.\\
         Then $f(z+z_0) = \alpha z$, thus, define $\hat{F}(z) := \alpha z$.\\
         We can assume $f(z) = \alpha z$ (mod $\wedge$). Remember, $f:\mathbb{C}/\wedge\to \mathbb{C}/\wedge$ so the $\alpha$ we
         choose must preserve $\wedge$ so that we choose
         \[ \alpha\wedge \leq \wedge \implies \wedge \mapsto \wedge \]
         Hence, there exists $a,b,c,d\in\mathbb{Z}$ such that $\alpha \cdot 1 = a + b\tau$ and $\alpha\cdot\tau = c+d\tau$.
         Now, it is an exercise to check if $\alpha$ is a quadratic.
         \begin{align*}
             \tau = (\alpha - a)/b \\
             \alpha(\alpha - a)/b = c + d(\alpha - a)/b \\
             \implies \alpha^2 -a\alpha = cb + d\alpha - da\\
             \implies \alpha^2 - (a+d)\alpha + (ad-bc) = 0
         \end{align*}
         (or you can recognize $\tau$ is an eigenvalue which implies the characteristic polynomial)
         \[ |\alpha|^2 = ad - bc\]
         Note, $|\alpha|^2$ is degree of $f(z) = \alpha z$ because Area$(\alpha P) = |\alpha|^2$Area$(P)$ where
         \[ P = \{u + vz: 0\leq u\leq 1, 0\leq v\leq 1\} \]
         Note if $\alpha = 2$, you have 4 pre-images of a point so $\#\{f^{-1}(z)\} = |\alpha|^2$
         Thus, $\alpha^2 + p\alpha + d =0$. Then, $p^2 -4d < 0$ because $\alpha\not\in\mathbb{R}$ (unless it is $\mathbb{Z}$).\\

         Now we want to compute $J(f)$. If $|\alpha|>1$, why is $J(f)$ everything?\\
         Take $(f^n)'(z) = |\alpha|^n \to +\infty$ so $J(f) = \mathbb{C}/\wedge$. Note periodic points are dense in $\mathbb{C}/\wedge$
         and if $|\alpha|<1$, then $|(f^n)'(z)|\leq 1$ for all $n$, for all $\tau$. This implies,
         \[ (f^n)'\quad\text{is a normal family} \]
         which implies that the family of functions is normal ($\mathbb{C}/\wedge$ compact). This concludes the proof.
    \end{proof}

    \subsection{Dynamics on Hyperbolic Surfaces}

    If $S$ is compact and hyperbolic, then each automorphism $f$ has finite order i.e. there exists $n$ such that $f^n \equiv$ id.

    \begin{lemma}
        If $S$ is hyperbolic and $f:S\to S$ holomorphic then $J(f) = \emptyset$.
    \end{lemma}

    Note: In general for a holomorphic map $f: S\to S$ of any arbitrary (not necessairly compact) Riemann surface, the family
    $(f^n)$ is normal if $f$ is either:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item it contains a locally uniformily convergent subsequence or
        \item contains a subsequence which diverges locally uniformily.
    \end{itemize}
    In this sense, $f_n(z) = z + n$ with $f:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}$ is normal.

    \begin{proof}
        By Montel, if $S$ is hyperbolic, any family of functions $S\to S$ is normal and so it is hyperbolic.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{theorem}[Classification of Hyperbolic Surfaces]
        Let $f:S\to S$ be holomorphic with $S$ hyperbolic. Then either:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Attracting case:} if $f$ has an attracting fixed point $z_0$, then all orbits converge (uniformily on compact
                subsets) to $z_0$.
            \item \textbf{Escape:} if some orbit has no accumulation point in $S$, then for any compact $K\subseteq S$, there exists
                $n_k$ such that $K\cap f^n(K) = \emptyset$.
            \item \textbf{Finite Order:} if $f$ has 2 distinct periodic points, then $f$ has finite order.
            \item \textbf{Irrational Rotation:} $S$ is an isomorphic to either $\mathbb{D}$, $\mathbb{D}/\{0\}$ or $A_r =
                \{z: 1<|z|<r\}$, and $f$ is conjugate to $z\mapsto e^{2\pi i\theta}$ with $\theta\not\in\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{theorem}

    \begin{corollary}
        If $f:\hat{\mathbb{C}}\to\hat{\mathbb{C}}$ has a rational map and $U$ is a component of the Fatou set which contains
        $z_0\in U$ which is an indifferent fixed point, then $U$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{D}$ and $f|_U$ is conjugate to an
        irrational rotation. In this case, $U$ is called a \textbf{Siegel Disk}.
    \end{corollary}

    \begin{proof}[Proof of corollary]
        We are not in finite order case since indifferent fixed point. Thus, it must be case 4 by exclusion.
    \end{proof}

    Note if a component $U$ of the Fatou set is such that $f|_U$ is conjugate to an irrational rotation, then $U$ is called a
    \textbf{Herman Ring}.\\

    Note this corollary does not offer existence of such disks or rings. If $f_{\theta}:e^{2\pi i\theta}z + z^2$ and
    $\theta$ has bounded continued fraction expansion, then $f_{\theta}$ has Siegel disk at 0.\\

    If $S = \mathbb{D}$ (case 2), then
    \begin{theorem}[Wolff-Denjoy]
        Let $f:\mathbb{D}\to\mathbb{D}$ be holomorphic. Then either:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $f$ is conjugate to a rotation (i.e. an isometry for PoincarÃ© metric with one fixed point)
            \item $(f^n)$ converge, uniformily on compact subsets to a constant $z_0\in\mathbb{D}\cup\partial{(\mathbb{D})}$.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{theorem}

    In general, we have:
    \begin{lemma}
        If $U$ is a hyperbolic subset of a non-compact Riemann surface and the map $f:U\to U$ extends continuously to a neighborhood
        of $\partial U$, then if some orbit of $f$ does not have an accumulation point in $U$, then $(f^n)$ converges locally
        uniformily to some $z_0\in U$ such that $f(z_0) = z_0$.
    \end{lemma}

    Now we prove Wolff-Denjoy using the classification of Hyperbolic Surfaces.
    \begin{proof}
        Suppose we are in case 2, the escape case. We know there exists some $(f^n(z))$ unbounded orbit. Consider for
        $\epsilon>0$:
        \[ f_{\epsilon}(z) = (1-\epsilon) f(z) \]
        Then, $f_{\epsilon}(\overline{\mathbb{D}})\subsetneq \overline{\mathbb{D}}$.\\
        Since this is a map $\mathbb{D}\to\mathbb{D}$, by Brauwer fixed point theorem, there exists $z_{\epsilon}\in\mathbb{D}$
        such that 
        \[ f_{\epsilon}(z_{\epsilon}) = z_{\epsilon}. \]
        Since $f_{\epsilon}$ weakly contracts in the PoincarÃ© metric, $z_{\epsilon}$ is unique. If $z_{\epsilon}\to z_0\in\mathbb{D}$,
        then $f(z_0) = z_0$ so we are in case (1), (3) or (4) so there  must be a sequence $\epsilon_k\to 0$ such that
        $z_{\epsilon_k}\to z_0\in\partial\mathbb{D}$.\\

        Consider,
        \[ B_k = \{z\in\mathbb{D}: d_{\mathbb{H}}(z,z_{\epsilon_k}) \leq d_{\mathbb{H}}(0,z_{\epsilon_k})\} \]
        Each $B_k$ is in fact a round disk for the Euclidean metric (but center is not $z_{\epsilon_k}$. Note $f_{\epsilon_k}\to f$,
        hence $f(B_{\infty})\subseteq B_{\infty}$. Now your orbit is trapped in the disk. The only limit point of
        $(f^n(z))$ must be in $B_{\infty}\cap\partial\mathbb{D} = \{z_0\}$. Hence,
        \[ \lim_{n\to\infty} f^n(z) = z_0 \]
    \end{proof}

    \begin{definition}
        If $(X,d)$ is a compact metric space, define
        \[ d_{\text{Haus}}(K_1,K_2) = \inf\{\delta>0:K_1\subseteq N_{\delta}(K_2),K_2\subseteq N_{\delta}(K_1)\} \]
        with $K_1,K_2\subseteq X$ compact subsets. $N_{\delta}(A) = \{x:d(x,A)<\delta\}$. Thus space of compact subsets of
        $(X,d)$ is then a compact metric space.
    \end{definition}

    Finally, we now prove the Classification of Hyperbolic Surfaces theorem. However, we only cover the first two cases.

    \begin{proof}
        Pick $p_0\in S$. Consider $p_n = f^n(p_0)$. Either, (1)
        $\lim_{n\to\infty} d_S(p_0,p_n) = +\infty$. Then pick $q_0\in S$ such that $d_S(p_0,q_0)\leq r$
        \[ d_S(p_0,q_n)\geq d_S(p_0,p_n)-d_S(p_n,q_n) \geq d_S(p_0,p_n) -r \to \infty \]
        so we are in the escape case.\\

        (2) Otherwise, there exists $n_j\to\infty$ such that $p_n(j)\to\hat{p}\in S$. Now, consider
        \[ g_j = f^{n(j+1)-n(j)} \]
        which implies
        \[ g_j(p_n(j)) = p_n(j+1) \]
        If we take the distance,
        \[ r_j = d_S(\hat{p},p_{n(j)})\leq r_j \]
        then,
        \[ d_S(g_j(\hat{p}),g_j(p_{n(j)})) \leq r_j \]
        which implies,
        \[ d_S(g_j(\hat{p}),p_{n(j+1)})\leq r_j \]
        so that,
        \[ d_S(g_j(\hat{p}),\hat{p}) \leq d_S(g_i(\hat{p}),p_{n(j+1)}+d_S(p_{n(j+1)},\hat{p})) \leq r_j + r_{j+1} \to 0 \]
        Hence $(g_j(\hat{p}))\subseteq B_r$ compact. Hence, $(g_j)$ is locally uniformily bounded because $\hat{p}$ maps to a
        bounded set. Hence, there is a limit function $g:S\to S$ with $g(\hat{p}) = \hat{p}$ so that $\hat{p}$ is fixed.\\

        Then there are two cases, (1) Distance-Decreasing case and (2) Distance-Preserving Case.\\

        (1) If $f$ decreases PoincarÃ© distance, then $g$ also does. Also, $f,g$ commute ($g$ an iterate of $f$). Hence,
        $f$ maps fixed points of $g$ to itself: $f($Fix$(g))\subseteq$ Fix$(g)$ because,
        \begin{align*}
            z\in\;\text{Fix}(f),\qquad f(z) = z \\
            f(g(z)) = g(f(z)) = g(z) \\
            \implies g(z) \in\;\text{Fix}(f)
        \end{align*}
        Since $f,g$ strictly decreases the metric,
        \[ \#\text{Fix}f = 1,\qquad \#\text{Fix}g = 1 = \{\hat{p}\} \]
        which implies $f(\hat{p}) = \hat{p}$ so $f$ does have a fixed point and so it must contract the PoincarÃ© metric.
        Therefore, $\hat{p}$ is an attracting fixed point.\\

        (2) Suppose $f$ is a local isometry for the PoincarÃ© metric. There is a sequence $g_j = f^{n(j+1)-n(j)}$ such that
        $g_j\to g$ and also $g(\hat{p}) = \hat{p}$. Then,
        \[ |g'(\hat{p})| = 1 \implies \hat{g}'(p) = e^{2\pi i\alpha} \]
        Now, we can find powers of this such that the function gets closer to id i.e.
