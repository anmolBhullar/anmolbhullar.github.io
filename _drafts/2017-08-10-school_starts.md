title: Thoughts and goals on my third year at university
summary: What I expect from my courses, my goals for the year, and adding a new major to my degree
---

The 2017-2018 year is my third one at University of Toronto, Scarborough. I am taking MATC63
(Differential Geometry), MATC27 (Topology), MATC34 (Complex Numbers), CSCB36 (Theory of Computation),
STAB52 (Intro. to Probability) along with MATC09 (Intro. to logic) but I will more than likely end
up dropping this course.

My goals from STAB52 is to become comfortable doing "applied" (i.e. not proofs) problems, and to
become good at counting problems which have been the bane of my existence since grade 12 of
highschool. I want to make them my bitch but most importantly never to be scared of these types
of problems.

My goals from MATC34 and MATC63 is to a) learn the material because I find it very interesting, b)
develop good relationships with the professors who teach these two courses. Both of these courses
on their own are not as theoretical as I'd like them to be so my plan is to study the material
taught in these  courses but also supplement it with material found in some more theoretical books.
On b), I want to develop good relationships with these professors, because I might sometime later
down the road ask to do a readings course with them or even an NSERC with them (if my grades are
good enough).

It is imperative I do well in CSCB36 as I want to TA it later it in the future. Nothing much else
I want to say about this course.
